The [`Android`](https://source.android.com/docs/core/interaction/sensors/sensor-types) platform supports `three` broad categories of sensors: 

-----------------

- `Motion sensors`

These sensors measure acceleration forces and rotational forces along three axes.

These include:

    Accelerometers
    Gravity sensors
    Gyroscopes
    Rotational vector sensors

<br>

- `Environmental sensors`

These sensors monitor various environmental properties.

These include:

    Ambient humidity
    Illuminance
    Ambient pressure
    Ambient temperature

<br>


- `Position sensors`

These sensors determine the position of the device.

These include:

    Geomagnetic field sensor
    Accelerometer sensor

<br>

Some other sensors in a smartphone include: 

    Barometer
    Thermometer
    Light intensity sensor
    GPS
    Gyroscope
    Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor
    Finger Print Sensor
    Magnetometer
    Microphone
    Near Field Communication Sensor
